    <td><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">This simulation allows you to experiment with
          the design of a flashlight. You'll  see how the flashlight works and how to match its batteries to its bulb.
          You’ll also  observe the flow of power from the batteries to the bulb
          by way of an electric current.</span></p>
      <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Begin setting up your flashlight by
          choosing the number of batteries it uses. The flashlight can have from 1 to 4
          batteries. A flashlight with 4 batteries can provide more power than one with 1
          battery and can be brighter as a result.</p>
        <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Next, choose the electrical resistance of
          the flashlight’s bulb. That resistance will control the amount of current
          flowing in the flashlight’s circuit once you turn the flashlight on. Your
          choice can range from 0.1  to 100 ohms. The more current that flows
          in the circuit, the more power that current  carries from the batteries to
          the bulb.</p>
      <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Now choose the bulb’s rated power, the
          power at which the bulb has been optimized to produce bright white light
          without burning out quickly. This power should match the power that flows from
          the batteries to the bulb when the flashlight is on. If the bulb receives much
          more than its rated power, it will glow blue-white and burn out too quickly. If it receives much
          less than its rated power, it will glow a dim red. </p>
        <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">As you set up your flashlight, you'll see the voltages are several points in its circuit. Because the flashlight
          is off, however, its circuit is open and no current flows.</p>
        <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When you click on the flashlight’s on/off
          switch, that switch closes the flashlight’s circuit and the voltages at points
          in the circuit now reflect its completion. Current flows around the closed
          circuit,  indicated by  green positive charge, and the amount of that
          current is displayed below the flashlight.</p>
        <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">When you click the flashlight’s on/off
          switch again, the switch opens the flashlight’s circuit and the light vanishes.
          Whether or not the flashlight is on, you can make adjustments to the
          flashlight’s characteristics and see what happens. You can also reverse one of
          the flashlight’s batteries. If you accidently burn out the bulb, press the
          “Replace bulb” button to fix it.</p>
        <P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.35cm">Units: &#8486; is ohms, A is amperes, V is
          volts, and W is watts.</p>
